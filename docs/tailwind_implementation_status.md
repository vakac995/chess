# Tailwind Improvements Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… **Setup Tooling**:
   - Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS was already configured in `.prettierrc`

2. âœ… **Define Initial Vision Strategy & CSS Variables**:
   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` with CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing, and border-radius
   - Defined semantic color names that map to CSS variables

3. âœ… **Create Theme Files**:
   - Created `src/styles/themes/` directory
   - Implemented `corporate.css` (default theme) and `casual.css`
   - Added theme imports to the main CSS file

4. âœ… **Implement Vision Switching**:
   - Added JavaScript logic in `main.tsx` to set/get `data-vision` on `<html>`
   - Implemented vision persistence using `localStorage`
   - Created a `VisionSwitcher` component for toggling between themes

5. âœ… **Refactor Core Layout & Global Styles**:
   - Updated global styles in `index.scss` to use the new theme variables
   - Applied transitions for smooth theme changes

6. âœ… **Incrementally Refactor Components (Partial)**:
   - Created a new themed `Button` component using `cva`
   - Refactored `Container` component with `cva` and themed variables
   - Updated `Header` component to use themed colors and the new `Button` component

## Remaining Tasks

7. ðŸ”² **Continue Component Refactoring**:
   - Still need to refactor: `Card`, `Dialog`, `Footer`, and other components
   - Use the semantic theme utilities (`bg-primary`, `rounded-button`, etc.) consistently

8. ðŸ”² **Refactor Page-Level Styles**:
   - Update styles in pages and layouts to use theme-aware utilities

9. ðŸ”² **Documentation**:
    - Document how to add a new vision
    - Provide guidelines for consistent theme usage

## Notes

- The `class-variance-authority` (cva) library is being used to create variant-based styling for components
- The `clsx` utility is used for conditionally applying classes
- The vision system is now working using CSS custom properties (CSS variables) with the format:
  - Colors: `hsl(var(--color-primary) / <alpha-value>)`
  - Spacing: `var(--spacing-container-padding)`
  - Border radius: `var(--border-radius-button)`

## How to Test

1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Use the VisionSwitcher component that appears at the top of the app to toggle between "Corporate" and "Casual" themes
3. Observe how components like Button, Container, and Header adapt to the active theme
