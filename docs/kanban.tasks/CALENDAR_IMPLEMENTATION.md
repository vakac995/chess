# Feature: Calendar Component Implementation

## 📋 Overview

**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive Calendar component using react-day-picker library that supports three distinct selection modes: single date, range selection (single calendar), and range selection (dual calendar).

**Related Feature/Fix/Standardization**: New Feature - Calendar Component System

**Start Date**: 2025-05-29
**Status**: ⏳ In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Assignee**: GitHub Copilot

---

## 🎯 Task Goals

- Implement a flexible Calendar component system using react-day-picker
- Support three calendar modes: single date selection, range selection (single calendar), and range selection (dual calendar)
- Follow established project patterns and conventions from PATTERNS.md
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing with standardized props interfaces
- Implement comprehensive state management using Jotai atoms
- Add proper validation using Zod schemas
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Create comprehensive test coverage

---

## 📖 Background & Context

The project requires a modern, accessible calendar component for date selection functionality. After analyzing multiple calendar libraries (detailed in CALENDAR_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPARISON.md), react-day-picker was selected due to:

- Modern TypeScript-first design with excellent type support
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Minimal, customizable styling that works with Tailwind CSS
- Active maintenance and smaller bundle size
- Comprehensive selection modes support
- Integration with date-fns for reliable date operations

The implementation must follow the standardized patterns established in the project's standardization plan, including:

- Component naming conventions (`{ComponentName}Props`)
- Named export patterns
- Proper file organization with `.types.ts` files
- Jotai state management patterns
- Zod validation schemas
- Path alias usage (@/)

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

The implementation follows a structured approach with clear dependencies between phases:

### **Sequential Implementation Strategy**

1.  **Phase 1 (Dependencies & Setup)** - Foundation setup and dependency installation
2.  **Phase 2 (Core Types & Schemas)** - Type system foundation following standardized patterns
3.  **Phase 3 (State Management)** - Jotai atoms for calendar state management
4.  **Phase 4 (Core Components)** - Implementation of three calendar mode components
5.  **Phase 5 (Component Integration)** - Integration, prop forwarding, and accessibility
6.  **Phase 6 (Hooks & Utilities)** - Supporting infrastructure and utility functions
7.  **Phase 7 (Styling & Theme)** - Visual polish and responsive design
8.  **Phase 8 (Testing & Validation)** - Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

### **Phase Dependencies**

- **Phase 2** depends on **Phase 1** (types need dependencies installed)
- **Phase 3** depends on **Phase 2** (atoms need type definitions)
- **Phase 4** depends on **Phase 2 & 3** (components need types and state)
- **Phase 5** depends on **Phase 4** (integration needs core components)
- **Phase 6** depends on **Phase 4** (hooks need components to exist)
- **Phase 7** depends on **Phase 5** (styling needs integrated components)
- **Phase 8** depends on **all previous phases** (testing needs complete implementation)

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

- **External Dependencies**: react-day-picker, date-fns installation
- **Project Dependencies**: Existing standardization patterns must be maintained
- **Type System**: Must use established @/types infrastructure
- **State Management**: Must integrate with existing Jotai setup
- **Testing**: Must work with existing Vitest + React Testing Library setup
- **Styling**: Must use existing Tailwind CSS configuration

---

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges & Risks

- **Library Learning Curve**: react-day-picker has specific patterns and APIs that need to be understood
- **Complex State Management**: Managing state for three different calendar modes can be complex
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Ensuring full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requires careful implementation
- **Date Handling Edge Cases**: Date ranges, timezones, and edge cases need proper handling
- **Styling Consistency**: Ensuring calendar styling matches project design system
- **Performance**: Large date ranges or complex interactions might impact performance
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Calendar components can be challenging to make responsive
- **Bundle Size**: Adding new dependencies increases bundle size

## 📝 Notes & Discussion

- Documentation references:
  - `CALENDAR_COMPONENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SIMPLIFIED.md` - Primary implementation guide
  - `CALENDAR_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPARISON.md` - Library comparison and selection rationale
  - `PATTERNS.md` - Project conventions and patterns to follow
- Library choice rationale documented in comparison document
- Implementation should prioritize accessibility and user experience
- Consider adding keyboard navigation enhancements
- May need to customize react-day-picker styling to match project theme
